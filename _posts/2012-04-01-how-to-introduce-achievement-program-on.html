PunchTab ,the company responsible for it has now come up with a new product called the Achievement Program. Rather than awarding coupons to users for showing their Loyalty (a.k.a. Liking ,+1'ing ,etc ) , it focuses on giving users Social Rewards to drive behavior. Users unlock badges for visiting, liking, tweeting, +1'ing, sharing or commenting. This creates a healthy competition between users to earn more and more badges and achievements ,in the process promoting your content.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><p class="imports" >In this post we will be discussing the following:<br /><br />- How the Achievement Program Works<br />- How to integrate it into your Blog<br />- Some things to Note</p><p class="headings imports" >How it Works</p><span style="font-size:15px;" >It requires the user to authenticate using Facebook Connect. After that they can start earning Badges for the following activities:<br /><br /><i>Visiting</i> – for their first visit they get the <b>Bike Badge</b> and these are followed by other badges in the category<br /><i>Liking</i> – for their first Like on your site users will get the <b>Smiley Badge</b><br /><i>Tweeting</i> – for their first Tweet on your users will get the <b>Budding Badge</b><br /><i>+1'ing</i> – for their first Google +1 on your site users will get the <b>Tuned In Badge</b><br /><i>Commenting</i> – for their first comment users will get the <b>Megaphone Badge</b><br /><br />There are two secret badges which are awarded when you become really active on the specific blog/website <br /><br /><p class="headings imports" >How Do I integrate it into my Blog</p><br />1. Go to <a href="http://www.punchtab.com/">Punchtab</a> and register yourself there if you haven't and then Login to your account , you will be redirected to the Dashboard<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SfJidWePgYE/T3kj40PC5qI/AAAAAAAADmk/n9g9pA2w7OM/s1600/1.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="PunchTab Dashboard" height="236" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SfJidWePgYE/T3kj40PC5qI/AAAAAAAADmk/n9g9pA2w7OM/s640/1.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />2. Now click the Achievement Program in the main menu above and then you will be asked to choose your platform<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2QjDIR5FnY/T3kj7LfTaRI/AAAAAAAADms/ht50_gLgPKY/s1600/2.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="choose blogging platform" height="209" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2QjDIR5FnY/T3kj7LfTaRI/AAAAAAAADms/ht50_gLgPKY/s640/2.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />3. Now click on the Blogger Icon and then you will be asked where would like the Badges to be positioned on your blog.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCN6jROZBVs/T3kj8z0nxiI/AAAAAAAADm0/UExmo1M5KB0/s1600/3.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="position of PunchTab badges" height="428" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCN6jROZBVs/T3kj8z0nxiI/AAAAAAAADm0/UExmo1M5KB0/s640/3.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />4. After choosing the position ,click the Install Achievement Program button below it and you will be asked to install its widget in your blog <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mq43xBxUJWw/T3kj9vev_JI/AAAAAAAADm8/BqIwonXL2EM/s1600/4.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="Install PunchTab widget on your Blog" height="168" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mq43xBxUJWw/T3kj9vev_JI/AAAAAAAADm8/BqIwonXL2EM/s640/4.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />5. After successfully installing the widget, you will see the Badges banner in the position you selected before.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VlISHpS8k-g/T3kj__rhsiI/AAAAAAAADnM/f0WNxYF6xto/s1600/6.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="Become a member of punchtab badges" height="46" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VlISHpS8k-g/T3kj__rhsiI/AAAAAAAADnM/f0WNxYF6xto/s640/6.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />6. Now click this Badges banner and register yourself through Facebook. Now you are ready to earn some badges <br /><br /><p class="headings imports" >Some things to Note</p><ul><li>Currently there is no Leaderboard for the Achievements you earned so you will just see how many badges you have earned and not how many others have earned.</li><br/> <li>You can run this exclusively on your blog or with the Loyalty program. Even though this will cause two notifications to appear together when you do a action. In my opinion a integration of both these programs would be a step forward in the right direction</li><br/> <li>In the near future PunchTab will add support for customized badges which will allow you to award them for actions define by you like following ,voting, etc</li><br/> <li>Placing the Badges in the top of your blog ,irrespective of whether it is right or left, sometimes causes problems of the posts being pushed up my a little. See the screenshot below <br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6-UStlnBhsw/T3kkBDkHX2I/AAAAAAAADnU/PHbtHJULAdk/s1600/7.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="Header slides up on installing punchtab Badges on the top" height="102" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6-UStlnBhsw/T3kkBDkHX2I/AAAAAAAADnU/PHbtHJULAdk/s640/7.PNG" width="640" /></a></li><br/> <li>The problem about +1 still exist , so if you Un +1 any content and +1 again , then you will be given a badge for it</li><br/> <li>The number of badges currently for offer are measly and doesn't really provide a rush in the users mind to respond to the call of action immediately . It would only take 3 days to earn all the badges in the +1'ing ,Tweeting, Liking, Visiting and Commenting category.</li><br/> <li>Blogger comments are supported but this feature became non-functional after the release of the Threaded Comments</li><br/> <li>Repositioning Badges other than their default position is a near impossible as moving them with CSS causes the whole container to shift which takes some part of the badges-won window out of the screen. See the screenshot below to get a idea of what I am talking about.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AtHYdwoS4DU/T3kkCTaRzMI/AAAAAAAADnc/DVyFjQpiwqs/s1600/8.PNG"  style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img class="thumb" alt="Punchtab badges cannot be repositioned" height="52" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AtHYdwoS4DU/T3kkCTaRzMI/AAAAAAAADnc/DVyFjQpiwqs/s640/8.PNG" width="640" /></a></li><br/> <li>None the less , its still in development and we expect that a lot of new features to be arriving soon enough</li><br/> </ul><P class="imports" >Announcement : I have introduced Badges on Stylify Your Blog , so you can also earn them by +1'ing ,liking ,tweeting and visiting. Make sure to claim your badges by doing these actions. Also from now on they will only load on Post pages in a bid to make SYB faster and also because only here does the real action (+1,Like,Tweet) happens.<p><br /><br /></span><br /><style>.post  li {list-style-type: square !important;margin-left:8px;} .imports {font-family:Electrolize;font-size:20px;text-shadow:2px 1px 3px #f9f9f9;} .headings {font-size:25px;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px gray;font-weight:bold;} .date-outer{margin-bottom:-10px;} </style>
