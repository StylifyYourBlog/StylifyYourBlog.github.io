<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/01/shifting-from-blogger-things-to-keep-in.html" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img class="thumb" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt2sp5aPz8M/TxWdoBk5xnI/AAAAAAAABuI/vFrZERQ11hc/s200/blogging+platform.png" width="173" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size: 15px;">Blogger is the best blogging platform out there in terms of features and cost. Even then some of us decide to shift to other platforms. The thing is that self hosted blogs have a sense of control and security. With&nbsp;legislations&nbsp;like <a href="http://techniciablog.blogspot.com/2012/01/list-of-sopa-supporters.html" target="new" >SOPA</a> and PIPA in pipeline, many people have started to think how Google ,FB and other services might become puppet in hands of the Government. This might be one of the leading reasons why people may want to make a switch. In this post I will be discussing which points to keep in mind while doing the switch.</span><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: large;">Blogging Platform</span></b><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"> There are lots of them out there and it can be sometime hard to choose one. The choice of the blogging platform should solely depend on the easy of use as well as and resources for troubleshooting problems. An active community can be really helpful when you hit unexpected road blocks while using the platform. Another thing to consider is the functionalities (a.k.a. possibility ) present ,sometimes this is the main reason for switching in the first place. Some examples are WordPress ,Drupal ,Joomla,etc,etc&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Hosting</b></span><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aWs_1bjHUGo/TyQj6y10hWI/AAAAAAAABwU/TlIrF6yzAb4/s1600/hostsearch.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img class="thumb" height="122" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aWs_1bjHUGo/TyQj6y10hWI/AAAAAAAABwU/TlIrF6yzAb4/s400/hostsearch.PNG" width="400" /></a><span style="font-size: 15px;">Choosing a hosting is a vital task ,because it will be your&nbsp;responsibility to make sure that your site is up every second. There are lots of high quality hosting&nbsp;options available within a affordable&nbsp;price but it can became a headache while choosing one . I suggest using services like </span><a href="http://www.hostsearch.com/" style="font-size: 15px;" target="_blank">Host Search</a><span style="font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;which give clear&nbsp;comparisons&nbsp;between various hosting providers with in detail reviews.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Import Your Stuff</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;">Shifting your blog from one CMS to another doesn't mean that you have to start from&nbsp;scratch again. There are tools available for exporting all your posts as well as comments into XML format which can then be easily imported. XML is a widely accepted format and mostly all major CMS'es have a Import functionality present for it. Though there might be problems when your transferring 2 million posts of yours !!</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Usability</span></b><span style="font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yQL8TPa_jWk/TxvUfm9x9kI/AAAAAAAABwI/OTeOl7oSSzE/s1600/usability+questions.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img class="thumb" height="133" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yQL8TPa_jWk/TxvUfm9x9kI/AAAAAAAABwI/OTeOl7oSSzE/s200/usability+questions.jpg" width="200" /></a><span style="font-size: 15px;">Before doing the actual switch, make yourself familiar with most of&nbsp;features&nbsp;of the new CMS or atleast the basic onces which you would be using frequently. This makes sure you don't hit any unexpected problems. Reading through the official Documentation of the&nbsp;specific&nbsp;CMS would be really helpful in these cases.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Test then Finalize</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;">When you have&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;shifted all your content to the new CMS, it is recommended that you keep the old blog up for atleast a month to make sure that all the traffic is directed to the new blog. As Blogger doesn't allow 301 Redirects it would be simpler to inform users by a sort of Banner on Top about the new Blog. There is a video by Google Webmaster Help explaining it in more detail.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/QyQs3tz7ZKo/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QyQs3tz7ZKo&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QyQs3tz7ZKo&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><br /><br /><br />It would be so Awesome if Google released a Self Hosting version of Blogger. It would be a step towards making <i>Blogger </i>the ultimate Blogging platform. Who is stopping from dreaming...
