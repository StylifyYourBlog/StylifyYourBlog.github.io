<a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/10/Changes-and-Issues-with-Blogger.html"   style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="changes issues" height="200" width="200" class="thumb" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yf5x5YS6NAY/UGxfJ1d4_oI/AAAAAAAAHgg/lU1gIKflsco/s1600/changeissue_bb6ddba0db2fc80d054d3bf3bb701c64.jpg" /></a><span style="font-size: 15px;">In the Past 39 Days there has been no new post and I sincerely apologize for that . Since I have started using Blogger again , I have come across some changes and issues that I would like to share with everybody.<br /></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-size: 15px;"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b class="imports headings">1. Old Interface Shelved</b><br />This happened around 20th September. Old Interface has now become fully inaccessible even if you are using direct links to it. This is what is shown instead<br /><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RAsmbCQ9Bao/UGsz724LiJI/AAAAAAAAHek/hdSVjLxodA0/s1600/nomoreoldui.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="no more old ui" class="thumb" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RAsmbCQ9Bao/UGsz724LiJI/AAAAAAAAHek/hdSVjLxodA0/s1600/nomoreoldui.PNG" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size: 15px;">This change has been well planned as the New Edit HTML Editor ( which came under the most fire from the users ) is now pretty stable and allows editing at par with the old one. This force upgrade also came in wake of the one-UI-all-across-policy of Google so that every Google Product has a kind of uniformity.<br /><br />If you are Old Interface fan like me then there are still some&nbsp;glimpse left of it here and there. Like when Uploading Images in the HTML mode of the Post Editor. After you press the Upload buttons , the&nbsp;confirmation&nbsp;screen has Old Interface styles (Screenshot&nbsp;below)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zuugHna6pN0/UGs1-4Q_e_I/AAAAAAAAHe4/lyzrWjKu8pQ/s1600/oldresidue.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="old interface screenshot" class="thumb" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zuugHna6pN0/UGs1-4Q_e_I/AAAAAAAAHe4/lyzrWjKu8pQ/s1600/oldresidue.PNG" /></a></div><br /><b class="imports headings">2. Extra Control over Link Structure</b><br />The ability to change the Link Structure has been around for a couple of months in the Draft Blogger interface but it has been rolled out in the Main interface as well. So now you can easily reword your links and they no longer depend on your post headings alone.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nKii1I_cUh4/UGs4A4hUayI/AAAAAAAAHfA/G8z0bfA-mWU/s1600/linkstructure.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="link structure " class="thumb" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nKii1I_cUh4/UGs4A4hUayI/AAAAAAAAHfA/G8z0bfA-mWU/s1600/linkstructure.PNG" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>A more advanced version of this feature would be ability to omit the year and month from the structure as well. But none the less its a step in the right direction<br /><br /><b class="imports headings">3. Mobile Custom Redirect Issue</b><br />This issue was&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;while using a mobile device (This requires that your User Agent is a mobile device like a Android , iPhone , Symbian or any other similar device). Also you must have a Custom Redirect setup to test this. When a user clicks on a custom Redirect URL , they are redirected to the Custom 404 Error Page. This happens because to serve the mobile version of your blog , Blogger attaches a query parameter ( ?m=1 ) which gets directly appended with the custom redirect and &nbsp;Blogger thinks of its as a URL itself<br /><br />For example check this URL -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/contact?m=1" target="new">http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/contact?m=1</a>&nbsp;( I have a redirect in place which redirects /contact to /p/contact.html )<br /><br /><br /><b class="imports headings">4. Comment Avatar Image and JS File Size and Issue</b><br />With the advent of the <a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/01/official-threaded-comment-good-and-bad.html" target="new">New Threaded Commenting System</a> in Blogger , it became clear that Blogger comments were second to none when comparing them with third party services like Disqus or <a href="http://www.stylifyyourblog.com/2012/08/installing-intensedebate-comments-in.html" target="new">IntenseDebate</a> . But while observing some things in the threaded comment system closely , I came across some shocking facts.<br /><br />Firstly the Avatar Image size of users who had integrated their account with Google+ was of the order of 512X512 px . This led to a lot waste in the bandwidth from Blogger side as well as it slowed down the loading of pages. In extreme cases a single image was wasting 200KB+ . I filed a request with the Blogger Dev Group and got a&nbsp;positive&nbsp;response but no action has been taken till yet. You can see the thread <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!msg/bloggerdev/lP8f8oO8b00/W9TyV3k1m1oJ" target="_blank">here</a><br /><br />Secondly the size of the JS file included inline as well as externally to make to Threaded Comment system work is a whooping 390KB+ as compared to the 15KB file that was included for the old comment system. After&nbsp;discovering&nbsp;this fact I am seriously considering to shift to a third party comment system which are way lighter.<br /><br /><br /><b class="imports headings">5. Naked Domain Redirect Issue</b><br />In the past 2-3 days there was been a widespread issue across Blogger where the <b><i>non-www</i></b> version of the Blog has stopped redirecting to the <i><b>www</b></i> version of the blog . Blogger team has released a step to step guide to solve this issue . You can check it <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!category-topic/blogger/how-do-i/RjTiNZUXi3g" target="_blank">here</a><br /><br />Stay tuned as I will be resuming my daily posting of helpful tutorials and tips<br /><br />If you have&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;any&nbsp;other&nbsp;change or issues while using Blogger , feel free to share them in the comments</span>
