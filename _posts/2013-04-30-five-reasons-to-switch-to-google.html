This move is a part of Google's ongoing initiative for plusification of its products but its a clear sign that Blogger is still and will remain a indispensable product in Google's arsenal. G+ Comments are also a clear challenge to the FB Comments , Disqus and other commenting systems even though it is yet to launched outside of Blogger officially. The presence of&nbsp;unofficial&nbsp;implementations for <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gplus_comments_block" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/search/Google%2B+Comments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>&nbsp;establishes&nbsp;the fact that its being liked by everybody out there. So if you one of those people who are still not convinced of using it on your blog then here are Five Solid Reasons that will surely make you change your mind<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b class="imports headings">1. Connected with&nbsp;everybody&nbsp;( Literally !! )</b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IuVjiVjNCEA/UX_mk_-sJ7I/AAAAAAAAK5k/itWnD3DYE4k/s1600/connect-blogger-blogs-and-google-plus.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="connect google+ and blogger" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IuVjiVjNCEA/UX_mk_-sJ7I/AAAAAAAAK5k/itWnD3DYE4k/s1600/connect-blogger-blogs-and-google-plus.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Lets think of a dream&nbsp;scenario&nbsp;, Somebody , Somewhere on the Web shares the link to your newest article and you are thanking them for doing it the very next minute. In reality other than when you get traffic from some popular website , many conversations about your blog on social media are ignored by you or you have no way to know that they are even happening out there. G+ Comments takes a dig at this problem by making sure that if-and-when a link to your article is shared on Google+&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;it will appear in the Comments sections with all its +1's and comments that were done on the original thread. Even though this is a small innovation yet it will help keep the&nbsp;conversation&nbsp;about your article either on the blog or social media in a single place<br /><br /><b class="imports headings">2.

Another aspect is the ability to see comments&nbsp;custom-tailored&nbsp;to you. So your Best Social Friends comments will be visible to you on the top&nbsp;irrespective&nbsp;of the fact that when they were posted <br /><br /><b class="imports headings">3.
